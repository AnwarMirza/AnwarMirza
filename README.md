I am Anwar. Welcome to my Github Space. I work with Python, MATLAB and other languages in areas related with Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic programming) and Computer vision. I am currently working as an adjunct professor in the beautiful city of Toronto, Canada. Formerly, I have wored at the King Saud University, Saudi Arabia and GIK Institute, Pakistan.

I am looking to collaborate on machine learning and AI projects.
